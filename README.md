# Spam Email Detection using NLP

## Overview
This project aims to detect spam emails using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms. The model analyzes the content of emails to classify them as either spam or legitimate (ham).

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of a collection of email messages labeled as spam or ham. Each email message is preprocessed and tokenized to extract relevant features for training the machine learning model.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: The text data is cleaned by removing punctuation, stop words, and other irrelevant characters. It is then tokenized and transformed into a numerical format suitable for machine learning algorithms.
2. **Feature Extraction**: The TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization technique is used to convert text data into numerical feature vectors.
3. **Model Training**: The preprocessed data is split into training and testing sets. A logistic regression classifier is trained on the training data to learn patterns in the text features.
4. **Model Evaluation**: The trained model is evaluated on the test set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess its performance in classifying spam and ham emails.

## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 95% on the test set, with high precision and recall values for both spam and ham classes.
